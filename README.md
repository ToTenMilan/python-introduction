### Codecademy Python course

##### Codecademy courses mostly are very explicit about how to do their tasks.
- In `script.py` I have copied less explicit, therefore more challenging tasks from [section 8.2](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-intermediate-en-rCQKw/0/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096)
- In `exam_statistics.py` I have copied little less explicit than usual tasks from [section 9.1](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-intermediate-en-7mgOa/0/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096)
